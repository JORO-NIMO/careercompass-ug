feat(assistant+analytics+ingestion+security): add chat-agent, AI usage dashboards/alerts, admin settings & IP access control

Assistant:
- Edge Function chat-agent with tool calling (search, match, subscribe) and multi-provider fallback (Groq/OpenAI/Gemini) with optional MODEL_OVERRIDE.
- Server-side enforcement: restrict assistant on /admin for non-admins.
- Client services/types + persisted assistant prefs (user_settings).

Analytics & Alerts:
- ai_usage_daily view + services/pages (Admin AI Usage) with sparkline.
- ai-usage-alerts Edge Function reads admin settings and notifies admins when daily tokens near quota.
- Workflow logs + delivery logs tables for observability.

Ingestion & Workflows:
- ingest-jobs (APIs + RSS with heuristics) inserts draft listings with dedupe.
- match-notify matches new jobs to alerts and sends notifications.
- parse-cv parses CVs and updates profile (skills/embedding).
- parse-email extracts jobs from newsletters with trust + dedupe.
- pg_cron schedules for ingestion/matching/digest.

Access Control & Admin:
- access-control Edge Function + client guard to block flagged IPs site-wide.
- Admin settings store (quota/threshold) + services.
- IP tracking table and admin management services.

SEO & UI:
- JobPosting JSON-LD components; new admin pages and charts.

Shared & Misc:
- Request ID helper; test-chat script; docs/workflows.

Follow-ups:
- Verify endpoints post-deploy; fix minor bug in admin_posts published_at; tune dashboards & IP UI.
